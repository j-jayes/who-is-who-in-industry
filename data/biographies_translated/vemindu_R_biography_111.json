        "description": "Gunnar Rudolf Rosengren was a distinguished director from Limhamn who had an extensive career in the field of casting and metalwork. He was born on September 4, 1889, in Limhamn. He was married to Ida Sörensson. His educational foundation includes an apprenticeship in Limhamn from 1903 to 1907 and attending Malmö Technical Evening School during the same period. Rosengren gained practical experience at Ludwigsberg and Bergsunds foundries in Stockholm from 1908 to 1909, followed by work at metal and art foundries in Berlin in 1911. In 1928, he studied art casting in Paris. From 1912 to 1930, Rosengren served as the Casting Master at J N Rosengrens Metallurgical Foundry in Limhamn, after which he was promoted to become the Managing Director, a position he held until his retirement. Besides his professional work, Rosengren held various leadership roles in organizations such as the Limh Craft Association, where he served as Chairman from 1925 to 1928, and the Swedish Foundry Masters Association, where he was a Vice Chairman since 1928. He was also involved in the Former Building Committee and served as an alderman in its order society. Rosengren actively contributed to the development of the community, serving as a board member of Drottn Josefinas Handicraft School and acting as a Trustee at Limh Savings Bank. Gunnar Rudolf Rosengren's Luminary Foundry, founded in 1909 by the late manufacturer J N R and transformed into a limited company in 1930, specialized in both art casting and commissioned machine work. The foundry currently boasts 10 crucible furnaces and one electric melting furnace."
